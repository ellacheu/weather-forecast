# Weather Forecast

## Description
The motivation to create this application was to create a weather forecast search engine.  When the user searches for a city, the current weather and a 5-day forecast for the searched city will be displayed.  Previously searched cities will appear in their search history list and saved into local storage allowing them to revisit that city's weather easily.  This application uses the OpenWeather API database to fetch current and future weather forecast.  I built this application to practice and apply the skills that I learned about fetching specified data from server-side APIs.  I learned how to concatenate API addresses based on of the documentation and gained future practice writing functions and storing data in local storage.  I've become more proficient and confident creating elements dynamically though Javascript.
